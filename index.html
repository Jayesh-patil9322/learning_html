    <H1>What is Lorem Ipsum</H1><hr>
    <p>
<h3>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <b>industry</b>. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of <i>type and scrambled</i> it to make a type <em>specimen book.</em> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <strong>electronic</strong> typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <mark>containing Lorem Ipsum passages</mark>, and more recently <u>with desktop publishing software</u> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</h3></p>
